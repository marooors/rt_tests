/*
 * getCpuFrequency.c: Get the number of CPU tick within a second
 *
 * This is a self contained (no dependency to any application include file) function,
 * which measures and returns the frequency of the CPU core it is running on.
 *
 * The macro "TEST_RUNS" defines how many measurements (1 sec. each) are
 * taken to get an average, final value.The first result is thrown away
 * (e.g. cache warming).
 *
 * In case of an error, <(uint64_t) -1> is returned.
